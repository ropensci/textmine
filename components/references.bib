  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
		  alternative evolutionary explanations.},

  abstract	= {Numerous evolutionary studies have sought to explain the
		  distribution of diversity across the limbs of the tree of
		  life. At the same time, ecological studies have sought to
		  explain differences in diversity and relative abundance
		  within and among ecological communities. Traditionally,
		  these patterns have been considered separately, but models
		  that consider processes operating at the level of
		  individuals, such as neutral biodiversity theory (NBT), can
		  provide a link between them. Here, we compare evolutionary
		  dynamics across a suite of NBT models. We show that NBT can
		  yield phylogenetic tree topologies with imbalance closely
		  resembling empirical observations. In general,
		  metacommunities that exhibit greater disparity in abundance
		  are characterized by more imbalanced phylogenetic trees.
		  However, NBT fails to capture the tempo of diversification
		  as represented by the distribution of branching events
		  through time. We suggest that population-level processes
		  might therefore help explain the asymmetry of phylogenetic
		  trees, but that tree shape might mislead estimates of
		  evolutionary rates unless the diversification process is
		  modeled explicitly.},

  abstract	= {Quantitative traits have long been hypothesized to affect

		  increased rates of diversification. Here, I present a
		  phylogenetic likelihood-based method (quantitative state
		  speciation and extinction [QuaSSE]) that can be used to
		  test such hypotheses using extant character distributions.
		  This approach assumes that diversification follows a
		  birth-death process where speciation and extinction rates
		  may vary with one or more traits that evolve under a
		  diffusion model. Speciation and extinction rates may be
		  arbitrary functions of the character state, allowing much
		  flexibility in testing models of trait-dependent
		  diversification. I test the approach using simulated
		  phylogenies and show that a known relationship between
		  speciation and a quantitative character could be recovered
		  in up to 80\% of the cases on large trees (500 species).
		  Consistent with other approaches, detecting shifts in
		  diversification due to differences in extinction rates was
		  harder than when due to differences in speciation rates.
		  Finally, I demonstrate the application of QuaSSE to
		  investigate the correlation between body size and
		  diversification in primates, concluding that clade-specific
		  differences in diversification may be more important than
		  size-dependent diversification in shaping the patterns of

		  richness across phylogenetic groups. Most explanations for
		  this disparity postulate that taxa with more species have
		  phenotypes or ecologies that cause higher diversification
		  rates (i.e., higher speciation rates or lower extinction
		  rates). Here we show that clade longevity, and not
		  diversification rate, has primarily shaped patterns of
		  species richness across major animal clades: more diverse
		  taxa are older and thus have had more time to accumulate
		  species. Diversification rates calculated from 163
		  species-level molecular phylogenies were highly consistent
		  within and among three major animal phyla (Arthropoda,
		  Chordata, Mollusca) and did not correlate with species
		  richness. Clades with higher estimated diversification
		  rates were younger, but species numbers increased with
		  increasing clade age. A fossil-based data set also revealed
		  a strong, positive relationship between total extant
		  species richness and crown group age across the orders of
		  insects and vertebrates. These findings do not negate the
		  importance of ecology or phenotype in influencing
		  diversification rates, but they do show that clade
		  longevity is the dominant signal in major animal
		  biodiversity patterns. Thus, some key innovations may have

  abstract	= {Ecology Letters (2011) ABSTRACT: It is increasingly being
		  recognized that global ecological research requires novel
		  methods and strategies in which to combine process-based
		  ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways.
		  Model-data fusion (MDF) is an emerging area of research in
		  ecology and palaeoecology. It provides a new quantitative
		  approach that offers a high level of empirical constraint
		  over model predictions based on observations using inverse
		  modelling and data assimilation (DA) techniques. Increasing
		  demands to integrate model and data methods in the past
		  decade has led to MDF utilization in palaeoecology, ecology
		  and earth system sciences. This paper reviews key features
		  and principles of MDF and highlights different approaches
		  with regards to DA. After providing a critical evaluation
		  of the numerous benefits of MDF and its current
		  applications in palaeoecology (i.e. palaeoclimatic
		  reconstruction, palaeovegetation and palaeocarbon storage)
		  and ecology (i.e. parameter and uncertainty estimation,
		  model error identification, remote sensing and ecological
		  forecasting), the paper discusses method limitations,
		  current challenges and future research direction. In the
		  ongoing data-rich era of today's world, MDF could become an
		  important diagnostic and prognostic tool in which to
		  improve our understanding of ecological processes while
		  testing ecological theory and hypotheses and forecasting
		  changes in ecosystem structure, function and services.},

  abstract	= {A characteristic signature of adaptive radiation is a
		  slowing of the rate of speciation toward the present. On
		  the basis of molecular phylogenies, studies of single
		  clades have frequently found evidence for a slowdown in
		  diversification rate and have interpreted this as evidence
		  for density dependent speciation. However, we demonstrated
		  via simulation that large clades are expected to show
		  stronger slowdowns than small clades, even if the
		  probability of speciation and extinction remains constant
		  through time. This is a consequence of exponential growth:
		  clades, which, by chance, diversify at above the average
		  rate early in their history, will tend to be large. They
		  will also tend to regress back to the average
		  diversification rate later on, and therefore show a
		  slowdown. We conducted a meta-analysis of the distribution
		  of speciation events through time, focusing on
		  sequence-based phylogenies for 45 clades of birds. Thirteen
		  of the 23 clades (57\%) that include more than 20 species
		  show significant slowdowns. The high frequency of slowdowns
		  observed in large clades is even more extreme than expected
		  under a purely stochastic constant-rate model, but is
		  consistent with the adaptive radiation model. Taken
		  together, our data strongly support a model of
		  density-dependent speciation in birds, whereby speciation
		  slows as ecological opportunities and geographical space
		  place limits on clade growth.},

  abstract	= {In this paper, I develop efficient tools to simulate trees
		  with a fixed number of extant species. The tools are
		  provided in my open source R-package TreeSim available on
		  CRAN. The new model presented here is a constant rate
		  birth-death process with mass extinction and/or rate shift
		  events at arbitrarily fixed times 1) before the present or
		  2) after the origin. The simulation approach for case (2)
		  can also be used to simulate under more general models with
		  fixed events after the origin. I use the developed
		  simulation tools for showing that a mass extinction event
		  cannot be distinguished from a model with constant
		  speciation and extinction rates interrupted by a phase of
		  stasis based on trees consisting of only extant species.
		  However, once we distinguish between mass extinction and
		  period of stasis based on paleontological data, fast
		  simulations of trees with a fixed number of species allow
		  inference of speciation and extinction rates using
		  approximate Bayesian computation and allow for robustness
		  analysis once maximum likelihood parameter estimations are
		  available. [Birth-death model; mass extinction;

  abstract	= {RAxML-VI-HPC (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for
		  high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel
		  program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum
		  likelihood (ML). Low-level technical optimizations, a
		  modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the
		  GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a
		  program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the
		  previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance
		  comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real
		  data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML
		  requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields
		  better trees in similar times than the best competing
		  program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets >
		  or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI.
		  RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel
		  multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting
		  trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two
		  of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463

  abstract	= {SUMMARY: DendroPy is a cross-platform library for the
		  Python programming language that provides for
		  object-oriented reading, writing, simulation, and
		  manipulation of phylogenetic data, with an emphasis on
		  phylogenetic tree operations. DendroPy uses a splits-hash
		  mapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances,
		  similarities and shape under various metrics. It contains
		  rich simulation routines to generate trees under a number
		  of different phylogenetic and coalescent models. DendroPy's
		  data simulation and manipulation facilities, in conjunction
		  with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data
		  formats (NEXUS, Newick, PHYLIP, FASTA, NeXML, etc.), allow
		  it to serve a useful role in various phyloinformatics and
		  phylogeographic pipelines. AVAILABILITY: The stable release
		  of the library is available for download and automated
		  installation through the Python Package Index site
		  (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DendroPy), while the active
		  development source code repository is available to the
		  public from GitHub

@Article{	  warren2008,
  abstract	= {Environmental niche models, which are generated by
		  combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS
		  data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental
		  questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the
		  accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The
		  question of whether environmental niches are conserved over
		  evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable
		  attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This
		  conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche
		  similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis
		  being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche
		  overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a
		  metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic
		  study of niche conservatism between sister species in
		  several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time,
		  address alternative definitions of "niche conservatism"
		  within a single framework using consistent methods. As
		  expected, we find that environmental niches of sister
		  species are more similar than expected under three distinct
		  null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We
		  demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic
		  comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an
		  adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that
		  environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic
		  overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that
		  niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in
		  this group to consist of closely related species. We
		  suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful
		  in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.},
